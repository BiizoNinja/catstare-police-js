# catstare-police-js
Slim Bun's "Catstare Police" was originally written in Python but I decided to do some trolling and replicated the bot into JavaScript. Feel free to use this shit code if you want.

Also Catstare Police isn't an invite-able bot. It's a custom bot written for [Catstare Community](https://discord.com/invite/HTkWe2H5yg).
